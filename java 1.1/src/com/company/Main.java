 This code includes ten programming problems. The challenges questions are from Tim Buchalka, an Udemy instructor who teaches the Java Programming Masterclass course.
 It's a fantastic approach to hone your coding abilities by writing methods. This set of ten questions is all about developing methods.
 I hope you like it, and have fun! There's always room for improvements. If you have any recommendations, please do not hesitate to share them with us.
 This program allows the user to select a challenge at random or on their own. If the user makes their own decision.
 The list of challenges will be presented in the program. When a user selects a challenge, it will provide additional information as well as four possibilities.
 if they need a clue, or a solution, or if they want to move on to the next challenge, or if they want to stop the program.
 The process continues until the user enters a value of -1 or an invalid value.
